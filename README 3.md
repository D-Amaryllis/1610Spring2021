I am testing out redacting things from the document
In order to utilize version control.
I think I am finally getting the hang of this.

I was sort of scared before.  
I'm not sure what I did wrongt he first time, but I ended up uninstalling and reinstalling Git.
When I did it a second time I did everythign the same as I had the first time.
This time it worked though?

I must have missed something the first time but boy howdy was it anxiety inducing when I had followed the instructions step by step and got incorrect results.
oof.
I'm gonna be okay though.

Scripting isn't something I am good at or have experience in
but I WANT to be good at it.
I'm excited about it.
So I'm not giving up.

Lets do this! (o_o)9
